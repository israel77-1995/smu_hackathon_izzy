### Handling Questions
**Common Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "How accurate is your medical AI?"**
A: "Our AI provides general health guidance with appropriate disclaimers. For serious conditions, we always recommend professional medical care. The key is early intervention and education."

**Q: "What about regulatory approval?"**
A: "We're designed as a health information tool, not a diagnostic device. We're POPIA compliant and working with SA health authorities for broader integration."

**Q: "How do you compete with Google/Microsoft health AI?"**
A: "Big tech focuses on developed markets. We're Africa-first - feature phone support, local languages, privacy-first architecture. They can't replicate our local focus."

**Q: "What's your user acquisition strategy?"**
A: "Partnership-driven: telecom operators for USSD, clinics for referrals, NGOs for community outreach, government for public health programs."

**Q: "How do you ensure AI safety?"**
A: "Multiple safety layers: emergency keyword detection, medical disclaimers, professional referrals, audit logging, and continuous model improvement."
